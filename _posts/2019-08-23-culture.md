## Culture muscles

> A well-built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it; no money can buy it. You cannot borrow it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it. You cannot hold onto it without constant work. It shows discipline, it shows self-respect, it shows patience, work ethic, and passion. That is why I do what I do.
> -- Arnold Schwarzenegger

I have always considered a well-built culture to act exactly how Arnie describes physique.
